These files overlay the files of https://www.zlib.net/zlib-1.2.11.tar.gz.

This build is designed for a Visual Studio 2019 (v14.2) build to be used with a Windows version 
of my TradeFrame application.

The solution file is at https://github.com/rburkholder/zlib-mem/blob/master/contrib/vstudio/vc14/zlibvc.sln
